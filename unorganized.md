- These components DO NOT require you to set up any additional infrastructure or deployment processes. As soon as you create them, they're available and update as you write code. (deployless)

- "View" toplevel (maybe a custom thing)
    - 3 modes: edit, view, split
        - when viewing a Handler that references  a View, render the View in an iframe adjacent to the Handler
            (for the trace in focus)
