# [5] Introduction

## What's Dark and what's it good for?
Dark is a new way of building serverless backends.
Just code your backend, with no infrastructure, framework, or deployment nightmares language, editor, framework, and infrastructure.

## Dark includes:

- the Dark language
- a standard library with base types and functions
- http handlers
- a package manager and packages
- REPLs
- Datastores
- Scheduled jobs (Crons)
- a static assets host
- the Editor
- and many integrations between these pieces

### CRUD apps
Get a working CRUD application in less than ten minutes by setting up a few API endpoints and a a datastore

### REST APIs and Webhooks
Set up an API endpoint quickly enough to use it as a proof of concept during a call. Immediately see the data from a webhook to your endpoint. Call an external API using the HttpClient library and see responses within the editor, or use workers to do work in the background. Use the built-in package manager to make external API calls really easily, and contribute your own API integrations

### Internal Tools and Bots
Dark is ideal for quickly building Slack bots and automating internal tools. Receive webhooks live, call out to third-party APIs, store data, and schedule jobs.

The language being connected to the editor and infrastructure allows interactive functions.

Dark also includes HTTP libraries for interacting with external APIs, a package manager to make that even easier, and built in functionality for datastores
Dark being connected to the editor and infra allows for unique lang. functionality

## Making a really simple drive-by application
